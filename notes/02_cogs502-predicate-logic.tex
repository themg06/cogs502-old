\section{Need for more expressive power}

\ezimeti{
\item Observe that propositional logic is not adequate to capture the following
reasoning:

\item[] \begin{quote}
		All thoughts are brain processes.\\
		Some thoughts are self-destructive.\\
		Therefore, some brain processes are self-destructive.
		\end{quote}


\item Logic, the art of formal reasoning, should be able to handle these types
of inferences; because whether the inference goes true is entirely dependent on
the organization of words like \emph{all}, \emph{some} and the positioning of
identical expressions.

		\begin{quote} All Frambulators are Cumulists.\\
		Some Frambulators are Sullberdian.\\
		Therefore, some Cumulists are Sullberdian.
		\end{quote}

		\begin{quote}
		All $F$ are $C$.\\
		Some $F$ are $S$.\\
		Therefore, some $C$ are $S$.
		\end{quote}
}

\section{Variables, quantifiers, formulas}
\ezimeti{
\item We enrich our language by introducing the following: 
\ezimeti{
\item[i.] A set of \uterm{predicate symbols}, possibly with subscripts in order
to not run out of symbols no matter how complicated our formulas can get. We use
upper case Latin letters to designate predicate symbols.

\item[ii.] A set of \uterm{variables}, again possibly with subscripts. We use lower
case Latin letters to designate variables.

\item[iii.] A set of \uterm{quantifier symbols}, namely $\{\forall,\exists\}$.
}
\item We will use upper and lower case Greek letters for variables over
predicate symbols and variables, respectively.

\item Now we can define the well-formed formulas of our language:

\begin{udefinition}[Well-formed formulas of predicate logic]
\ezimeti{
\item[]
\item[i.] $\Pi\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n$ is a wff iff $\Pi$ is a predicate symbol
and $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n$ is a
sequence of variables.

\item[ii.] ($\phi \land \psi$) is a wff iff $\phi$ and $\psi$ are wff's;\\ likewise
for, $(\phi \lor \psi)$, $(\phi \imp \psi)$, and $(-\phi)$.

\item[iii.] $\forall\alpha\phi$ and $\exists\alpha\phi$ are wff's iff $\phi$
is a wff and $\alpha$ is a variable.
}
\label{consdef}
\end{udefinition}

\begin{uexample} 
Observe how the formula in \xref{constree} is constructed on the
basis of definition \ref{consdef}.

\begin{align}
\label{constree}
\forall x((Sx\lor Wx)\imp \exists y(Ky\land Txy))
\end{align}

the tree on the right hand side is simplified by retaining only the
structure forming operations as node labels, namely connectives and `.' sign
for concatenation. Let us call it the \uterm{construction tree} of the formula
in \xref{constree}.


\begin{center}
\Tree [.$\forall x((Sx\lor Wx)\imp \exists y(Ky\land Txy))$ [.$((Sx\lor Wx)\imp\exists y(Ky\land Txy))$ 
		[.$(Sx\lor Wx)$ [.$Sx$ $S$ $x$ ] [.$Wx$ $W$ $x$ ]] 
		[.$\exists y(Ky\land Txy)$ 
							[.$(Ky\land Txy)$ [.$Ky$ $K$ $y$ ] [.$Txy$ $T$ $x$
							$y$ ] ]  ] ] ]
\hspace{20pt}
\Tree [.$\forall x$ [.$\imp$ 
		[.$\lor$ [.$.$ $S$ $x$ ] [.$.$ $W$ $x$ ]] 
		[.$\exists y$ 
							[.$\land$ [.$.$ $K$ $y$ ] [.$.$ $T$ $x$
							$y$ ] ]  ] ] ]
\end{center}
\end{uexample}




\item To keep the number of parentheses manageable, we follow the following
convention:
\ezimeti{
\item[] negation ($-$) and quantifiers ($\forall x$,$\exists v$, etc.) bind most tightly;
\item[] then comes conjunction ($\land$) and alternation ($\lor$)
\item[] finally conditional ($\imp$) binds least tightly.
}
}

\section{Occurrence, bondage, freedom, and substitution}
\ezimeti{
\item We call a \uterm{quantifier}, the expression formed by concatenating a
quantifier symbol and a variable. E.g.\ $\forall x$, $\exists z$.

\item[] {\bf Occurrence:}

\item An \uterm{occurrence of a variable} in a formula is a leaf (terminal) node
in the construction tree of that formula occupied by the variable. Question: how
many occurrences does the variable $x$ have in formula \xref{constree}?

\item Similarly an \uterm{occurrence of a quantifier} in a formula is a node in the
construction tree occupied by the quantifier.

\item[] {\bf Bondage versus freedom:}

\item An occurrence of a variable $\alpha$ is \uterm{bound} in a formula $\phi$ by an
occurrence of a quantifier $\forall\alpha$ (or $\exists\alpha$) if there exists a path from
$\alpha$ going up to $\forall\alpha$ (or $\exists\alpha$), and there exists no
other occurrence of $\forall\alpha$ (or $\exists\alpha$) along the path.

% \begin{uexercise}
% Mark the scopes of the quantifiers below:
% \end{uexercise}

\item An occurrence of a variable $\alpha$ is \uterm{free} in a formula $\phi$
iff $\alpha$ is not bound (by any quantifier) in $\phi$.

\begin{uexercise}
State which occurrences of variables are free and bound in the following
formula:

$$
((\exists x\, Fx \lor\forall x\, ((Gz \land Hx) \imp (\exists z\, Fz\lor Hz)))
\imp \exists z\, (Fy \lor Fz))
$$


\end{uexercise}

\item A formula is \uterm{closed} iff it has no free (occurrence of a) variable. 

\item[] {\bf Substitution:}

\item Given a formula $\phi$, 
$$\subs{\phi}{\beta}{\alpha}$$ 
is the formula obtained by substituting the variable $\beta$ to each and every
\emph{free} occurrence of variable $\alpha$ in $\phi$.


\item[] {\bf Accidental bondage:}

\item When substituting a variable for another one in a formula, care should be
taken NOT to introduce bondages that wouldn't be there if the substitution had
not taken place.  
\item[] Take for instance the formula

$$\exists y\, Lxy$$

with $L$ designating the binary predicate \emph{loves}, which says there is some
entity that $x$ -- whatever that is -- loves. Substituting $y$ for $x$ in this
formula, namely $\subs{(\exists y\, Lxy)}{y}{x}$, gives $\exists y\, Lyy$. This
says that there exists a self-loving entity. Something different and more
specific than our original formula. To avoid such situations we introduce the
following definition.

\item Variable $\beta$ is \uterm{free for} $\alpha$ in formula $\phi$ if no free
occurrence of $\alpha$ in $\phi$ stands along a path descending from a
quantifier $\forall \beta$  or $\exists \beta$.

\begin{uexercise}
Give $\subs{\phi}{y}{x}$ for the following $\phi$ and state whether $y$ is free
for $x$ in $\phi$:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\forall z\,(Px\imp Qz)$
\item $Fx \imp \forall x\, Fx$
\item $\exists z\,(\forall x\, Fx \imp Hx)$
\item $\forall y\,Fzy\imp \exists y\, Gxyz$
\end{enumerate}
\end{uexercise}

\begin{uexercise}
Express the following sentences in predicate logic:
\etaremune{
\item 
A sample was contaminated.
\item
Everything ends.
\item
Every semester ends.
\item
Every student admires some movie.
\item
If an instructor fails, every student passes.
\item
No student failed.
\item Some humans love math, but not all who love math are humans.
\item People without friends are unhappy unless they love reading.
}
\end{uexercise}
}

\section{Natural deduction}

\ezimeti{

\item All the rules and techniques of natural deduction for propositional logic
also apply to predicate logic.

\item In addition to them, we introduce introduction and elimination rules for
the quantifiers.\footnote{Note that we do not cover terms and identity,
therefore you may skip those parts in Huth\&Ryan.}


\item[] {\bf The universal quantifier:}

\item[] Elimination:

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\forall x\, \phi$}
\RightLabel{\scriptsize{$\forall x$ e}}
\UnaryInfC{\subs{\phi}{u}{x}}
\end{prooftree}
provided that $u$ is free for $x$ in $\phi$.



\item[] Introduction:
\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{\fbox{\parbox{40pt}{\flushleft{$u$}$$\vdots$$\centering{$\subs{\phi}{u}{x}$}}}}
\RightLabel{\scriptsize{$\forall x$ i}}
\UnaryInfC{$\forall x\, \phi$}
\end{prooftree}

The logic of the rule is: if you can prove that a formula holds for an
\emph{arbitrary} individual, then it holds for every individual. In order to
guarantee that $u$ is arbitrary, it is required that it is ``fresh'' in the
sense that it does not occur anywhere outside of the box. 

\item[] {\bf The existential quantifier:}

\item[] Introduction:

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\subs{\phi}{u}{x}$}
\RightLabel{\scriptsize{$\exists x$ i}}
\UnaryInfC{$\exists x\, \phi$}
\end{prooftree}

The idea is that if a formula holds for an individual, then you can deduce that
there exists something that makes the formula hold.

\item[] Elimination:

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\exists x\,\phi$}
\AxiomC{\fbox{\parbox[b]{60pt}{\flushleft{$u$}\quad\centering{$\subs{\phi}{u}{x}$}$$\vdots$$\centering{$\chi$}}}}
\RightLabel{\scriptsize{$\exists x$ e}}
\BinaryInfC{$\chi$}
\end{prooftree}
provided that $u$ is free for $x$ in $\phi$ and $u$  is ``fresh'' -- it does not
occur outside of the box.


Here the logic is similar to $\lor$-elimination. You know that $\phi$ holds for
at least one individual, but you do not know which. You assume an arbitrary
individual $u$ and that $\phi$ holds for it. If this assumption leads you to $\chi$,
which does not include $u$, then you can deduce that $\chi$ holds. 

Let's take a real-world example. Suppose you have 12 friends. You know that at
least one of them betrayed you. You sit and think about each, James, Andrew,
Matthew, Judas, and others. You find out that \emph{whichever} you pick as the
traitor, there is a reason that you are in trouble. As you know that at least one of them
\emph{did} betray you, you conclude that you are in trouble.  

\newpage
\begin{uexercise}
Prove the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\forall x\,(Px \imp Qx),\,\forall x\,Px\vdash\, \forall x\, Qx$
\item $\forall x\, \phi \vdash\, \exists x\, \phi$
\item $\forall x\, (Px \imp Qx),\,\exists x\, Px \vdash\, \exists x\, Qx$  
\item $\forall x\, (Qx \imp Rx),\,\exists x\, (Px \land Qx) \vdash\, \exists x\, (Px \land Rx)$  
\item $\exists x\, Px,\, \forall x\forall y\,(Px\imp Qy) \vdash\, \forall y\, Qy$
\item  $\vdash\,\exists x\, (Fx \imp \forall y\, Fy)$
\end{enumerate}
